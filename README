Diagrams in this directory, with owners and notes
-------------------------------------------------

Anyone may modify these diagrams (presuming you believe you know what
you're doing); the listed owner is just so that you have someone to
ask what's going on if you don't believe you know what you're doing
:-}. 

-- DM_DI_interface.dot (rdsmith): An attempt to sketch out the
   somewhat messy calls back and forth between the DownloadManager and
   DownloadItem.  Hopefully to be used as a guide at some point for
   cleaning up those calls.

-- RDH_objects.dot (asanka): Diagram of ResourceHandler chains used by
   ResourceDispatcherHost.

-- UI-interface-viewonly.dot (rdsmith): A class inheritance and
   reference diagram for the download UI system.  This covers the
   views (Windows) implementation only, as putting all three (or more)
   together gets messy.  There are minor differences between the
   systems, but Cocoa and GTK mostly follow this pattern.

-- download-initiation.dot (rdsmith): Diagram of the different
   pathways through which a download may be initiated.  

-- downloads_flow.dot (rdsmith): Diagram of all of the downloads
   interthread pathways south of DownloadResourceHandler.

-- filename-determination-control-flow.dot (asanka): Control flow used
   for initial filename determination during a download.
